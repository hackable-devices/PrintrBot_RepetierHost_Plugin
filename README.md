PrintrBotPlugin for Repetier Host
==============================

This is the sources of the PrintrBot Plugin for Repetier Host (Windows / Linux)

## Installing

To install the plugin, unzip one of the releases into the `C:\Program Files\Repetier-Host\plugins` folder (on Windows) or the equivalent in Linux. This plugin cannot be installed on the Mac version of Repetier-Host (not our fault ... Repetier-Host for Mac doesn't have a plugin system).

> NB : This plugin is provided as is, with no guarantee what so ever. It's here to help PrintrBot users to load/unload filament easily, and to calibrate the bot. Please contribute if you find a bug or need an improvement.
